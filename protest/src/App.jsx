          Freedom Studio is working with climate activists to strengthen their climate actions and movements in Nepal. Freedom Studio has been holding several formal/informal meetings with climate activists, community workers, civil society organizations, performers, designers, writers, and journalists to raise consciousness and solidarity for movement building in climate justice efforts. Our effort has been to design tactical, critical, strategic, and creative approaches for climate justice actions for movements led by climate activists and impacted people from climate change.
          <br />
          Freedom Studio has also been organizing intensive artivism workshops to directly connect, train, and support activists and artivists using creative and strategic tools for climate mobilization. In collaboration with communities, our organization has developed several high-quality art and more than 500 demonstration pieces in such workshops. Such art content has been displayed multiple times in public venues through open galleries, community gatherings, and markets. Some of the movements that Freedom Studio have been supporting are Peopleâ€™s Climate Mobilization 2021, and 2023, Justice to Dilip Mahato, Don't Gas Asia, End Fossil Fuel, etc.
